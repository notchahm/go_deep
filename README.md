# go_deep

The go_deep project is a simple machine learning library written for the Go programming language.

The primary purpose of the project is to serve as an exercise for me to learn about programming in Golang, while also providing some content that may be useful for the open source Go community. The code contained within is meant to be transparent and easy to understand, while also maintaining some extensibility to continue building a framework upon. While performance isn't a primary concern, it will allow for more efficient implementations as needed.

Initial contents include
 * Examples of end-to-end implementation of some simple machine learning classification algorithms
 * Some common machine learning operations, such as linear transforms and activations
 * Stochastic gradient descent based optimization
 * Various neural network layers as building blocks for deep learning implementations
